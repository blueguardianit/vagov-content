## Can I use VA health care while I'm still on active duty?

<b>You may be able to use VA health care if:</b>

- You need emergency or urgent care. We'll provide care first, and then get TRICARE authorization for care once we've stabilized your health. <br>
- You need routine care and you have a valid TRICARE referral or authorization.
- The VA health facility you're visiting has a VA/DOD sharing agreement that allows us to provide care without referrals. For more information about this, please contact your local military treating facility (MTF) or TRICARE office.

## What health care benefits will I be eligible for after separation or retirement?

This depends on your situation. Learn more about whether you'll be eligible, and how to apply for health benefits if you're:
- [Returning from OEF/OIF/OND combat](#oef-oif-ond)
- [Separating from active duty](#separating)
- [Retiring from active duty](#retiring)
- [Being medically retired from active duty](#medically-retired)

<span id="oef-oif-ond"></span>

### If you're returning from OEF/OIF/OND combat

You can receive cost-free medical care for any condition related to your service in the Iraq/Afghanistan theater for 5 years after the date of your discharge or release.

<b>When you apply for VA health care and if we determine you qualify for OEF/OIF/OND enhanced eligibility:</b>
- We'll enroll you right away. We'll assign you to priority group 6, unless you qualify for a higher priority group based on your income or a service-connected disability. <br>
[Learn more about priority groups]
- You'll receive free care and medications for any condition that may be related to your combat service. You may need to pay copays for care and medications that we determine are clearly not related to your military service, but you can submit your income as part of your application to apply for a copay exemption. <br>

- You'll stay enrolled in VA health care even after your OEF/OIF/OND enhanced eligibility period ends. Then we’ll assign you to the highest priority group you qualify for at that time. <br>
[Learn more about priority groups]

#### Important note: Don't wait to apply for VA health care

If you wait to apply for VA health care after your OEF/OIF/OND enhanced eligibility period ends, we won't factor your OEF/OIF/OND Veteran status into our decision on your enrollment. Instead, we'll base your eligiblity on factors such as your income and VA disability rating.

So even if you don't think you need medical care right now, we encourage you to apply for VA health care right away to take advantage of this enhanced eligibility period. <br>
