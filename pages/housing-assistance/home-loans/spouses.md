<div class="va-introtext">

To get a VA direct or VA-backed home loan as the surviving spouse of a Veteran, you’ll need a certificate of eligibility (COE) to show your lender that you qualify for this benefit based on your service history and duty status. Find out if you can get a COE. Keep in mind that you’ll also need to meet your lender’s credit and income requirements to get a loan.

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get a COE?

You may be able to get a COE if you’re the spouse of a Veteran, and at least one of the descriptions below is true for that Veteran.

**At least one of these must be true. The Veteran:**

- Is missing in action, **or**
- Is a prisoner of war (POW), **or**
- Died while in service or from a service-connected disability and you didn’t remarry, **or**
- Died while in service or from a service-connected disability and you didn’t remarry before you were 57 years old or before December 16, 2003, **or**
- Had been totally disabled and then died, but whose disability may not have been the cause of death (in certain situations)

**Note:** A surviving spouse who remarried before December 16, 2003, and on or after their 57th birthday, must have applied no later than December 15, 2004, to establish home loan eligibility. We must deny applications we received after December 15, 2004, from surviving spouses who remarried before December 16, 2003.

## Next steps for getting a VA direct or VA-backed home loan

Applying for your COE is only one part of the process for getting a VA direct or VA-backed home loan. Your next steps will depend on the type of loan you’re looking to get—and on your lender. For most loans, a private bank or mortgage company will be your lender. For the Native American Direct Loan, we’ll be your lender.
